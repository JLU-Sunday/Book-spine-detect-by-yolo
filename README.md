# Book-spine-detect-by-yolo
ðŸ§  Introduction
This project implements an improved Hough Transform algorithm for book spine detection in smart libraries. The method addresses challenges in traditional spine segmentation, such as low detection accuracy, poor robustness, and high computational demands.

We propose a lightweight, resource-efficient pipeline that improves traditional Hough line detection by combining:

Weighted Hough Space

Angle and Space Quantization Optimization

Adaptive Threshold Optimization

Geometry-Driven Line Segment Merging

Secondary Optimization Based on Geometric Constraints

This approach enhances spine localization accuracy while maintaining compatibility with real-time and low-resource embedded systems.
